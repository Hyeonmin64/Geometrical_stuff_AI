### Graph Embedding VAE: A Permutation Invariant Model of Graph Structure

<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08057.pdf>

- (Permutation invariance: degeneracy respectively), (Permutation equivariance: commutativity)
- GE-VAE is the jointly permutation-invariant generative model they made. and model is highly scalable
to large graphs with likelihood evaluation and generation in O(|V | + |E|).
